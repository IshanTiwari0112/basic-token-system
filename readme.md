ganache local blockchain emulator injected in remix and can be tested using remix ide and ganache(truffle)
--copy code into remix injecting ganache for accounts and use contract as needed
simple frontend built with no clientside validation and static html page(can be used with liveserver)

issue ran into while connecting the frontend to the deployed contract and could not figure out how to debug it
but possible solution would be to use hardhat and deploy the contract there.

--script js and start js were some ways tried to solve the frontend and backend connection

--used react app, ethers library, bootstrap and jquery libraries
